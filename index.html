        <p>The person leading the U.S. response to the <a
                href="https://elemental.medium.com/your-most-pressing-questions-about-the-coronavirus-answered-c99bff5f02e9">coronavirus

            Disease Control and Prevention, is preparing herself and her family for a possible pandemic that could cause
            “severe” disruption to everyday life as businesses curtail activity, schools possibly close, and social
            gatherings are discouraged.</p>

            because of this pandemic.”
        </blockquote>
